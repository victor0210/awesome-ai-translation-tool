# What AI Video Translators Are

AI video translators use artificial intelligence to translate video content, including audio and subtitles, into other languages automatically.  
Modern tools not only translate text but can also dub audio, generate subtitles, perform voice cloning, and even sync mouth movements in the video to the translated speech (lip-sync).
